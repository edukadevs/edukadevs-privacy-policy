            Edukadevs Privacy Policy
        </h1>
        <b>Last Updated: 16 October 2019, 02:20 AM (UTC+7)</b>

        <h2>Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Edukadevs itself <b>does not</b> collect or store any user data.
            However, its current sole application, <i>Edukade: Edukasi
            Adik-Adik</i>, is made using MIT App Inventor, which may (but
            likely won't) ask for user data such as microphone access.
            Here, Edukadevs states that <strong>all such requests shall be
            denied</strong>, as Edukadevs does not use any user data.
        </p>

        <h2>Child Safety</h3>
        <p>
            As of right now, Edukadevs only has one application, namely
            <i>Edukade: Edukasi Adik-Adik</i>, in which children can learn
            children's learning material, such as letters, numbers and basic
            vocabulary. We state that as of right now, <strong>all of
            Edukadevs' services do not contain any explicit, graphical, or
            non-family-friendly content</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>Implications Related to the Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            By using any of Edukadevs' services, you are expected to have read
            and understood this privacy policy.
